## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 is my favorite lab,I felt like it was a good practice of little topics combined. In part 1, we had to find the unit price of the pizza per square inch. I learned to properly use the arithmetic operators to use the given diameter to find the unit price. I love how this part taught me to use my knowledge of arithmetic operators to take the input and receive the desired output for calculating the unit price. Part 2, is another great practice for me with arithmetic operators but specifically focusing only on it. I learned to write function definitions by trying to find the date difference and Julian's day. 

* Lab 4, part 1 

    Lab 4 part 1 would be my second favorite only because I love a challenge to improve my ability. In lab 4 there were multiple files which I found intimidating and hard but this was good practice. For this part, we had to convert millimeters to other measurements in the U.S. customary systems. With all the conversions I learned how to initialize and declare doubles with practice. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 has to be one of my favorite labs because not only do I love the Mad Libs from part one but for part 2 I felt like a teacher teaching the program on how to find the arithmetic method. In part 1, I found it to be a fun little game. I felt like this part is a good example of the use of a vector. In part 1 the work on the program was about vectors and data cleaning. The code would identify the number of arguments and would show an error if not provided with 3 arguments to complete the mad lib (fill in the blank). Part 2, was a bit more challenging for my partner and me, but we were able to figure out how to apply the bool and use double. The double in the for loop was used in the code to receive the output of the average of test cases. In this lab, I learned more about vectors and command line arguments in a for loop.
